  <h1 id='main-title'>Welcome to the GTM playground! </h1>
  <p>The goal of this page is to see how different GTM tags and triggers interact with each other and how to prevent/allow tags to run.</p>
  <p>I wanted to create a couple of examples to understand how different events can affect tags from firing and what options does GTM provide.</p>
  <p>Just to be clear: the naming convention and the way tags are set up, the code that is in the tag itself are <b>not</b> what I would generally suggest. The examples here are purely to explore different solutions around tag triggering options GTM provides.</p>
  <p>If you want to play around with this page you can find more info on how to set it up on the <a href='https://github.com/nexusventuri/gtm-playground/'>project page</a>.</p>
