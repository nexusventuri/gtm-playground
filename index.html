<div>
  <h1 id='main-title'>Welcome to the GTM playground! </h1>
  <p>The goal of this website is to create a guide for developers to show TM works and to give a background on different concepts and possiblities that it unlocks.</p>
  <p>If you want to play around with those you can find more info on how to set it up on the <a href='https://github.com/nexusventuri/gtm-playground/'>project page</a>.</p>
  <p>You can clone the repository, load the different configurations and run the project locally.</p>

    <summary>Importing the container</summary>
    <p>Once you created a new container you can import the settings for each page by going on this page on your container:</p>
    <img style='width: 100%' src='images/import_container.png' />
  </details>

  <h3>Naming conventions</h3>
  <p>The naming convention and the way tags are set up, the code that is in the tag itself are <b>not</b> what I would generally suggest. The examples shown here are only to explain how GTM works.</p>
