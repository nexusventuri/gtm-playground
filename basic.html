  <h1 id='main-title'>What is GTM anyway? </h1>
  <p>I worked in a web shop back in 2006 and we were asked sometimes to add racking pixels on pages on our site. In order to do so we had to update the html for several pages on the site manually, we had to deploy our changes and test them. The feedback loop was horrible, and a new tag or tracking pixel took ages to set up.</p>
  <p>This is where GTM comes to help. Most of the tracking scripts/pixels required to use third party ads optimisation need just some minutes set up, with deployment and feedback loop leveraging on the google platform</p>

  <h2>Key concepts</h2>
  <p>There are 3 key concepts in google tag manager:
    <ul>
      <li>Tags</li>
      <li>Triggers</li>
      <li>Variables</li>
    </ul>
    Let's have a look at those concepts
